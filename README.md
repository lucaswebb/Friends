DOCS:

Given that getFriendWithName only takes a name input value, Friends with the same name but different hometowns should not be added.
This decision was made due to the assignment.  It called for a method that returns the friends of friends given just a name.
Thus, it is not feasible to have multiple Friends of the same name.
